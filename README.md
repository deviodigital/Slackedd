### :mega: ANNOUNCEMENT

**While the Slackedd plugin still works, as of now I do not see myself working with Easy Digital Downloads for a while.**

Feel free to fork and use this however you'd like.

### :book: DOC

If you run an online shop with [Easy Digital Downloads](http://wordpress.org/plugins/easy-digital-downloads/) and spend a lot of time in [Slack](https://slack.com), you can now receive notification through Slack when you make a sale in your shop.

Slackedd, once installed and configured, will send a notification to your Slack channel of choice every time you make a sale through your Easy Digital Downloads store.

If you spend a lot of time in Slack and would like to be notified when your digital products are being purchased without having to log into your WordPress dashboard, this plugin is the perfect solution.

**Requirements**

Slackedd requires the [Easy Digital Downloads](http://wordpress.org/plugins/easy-digital-downloads/) plugin to be installed and activated in order to work.

You will also be required to set up an incoming webhook for Slack, which you can do [here](https://my.slack.com/services/new/incoming-webhook/)

**Plugin Options**

Slackedd comes built with numerous ways to customize the output of the content through the Slack Bot. Options include:

* Bot name
* Bot icon
* Channel name
* Webook URL
* Hide order number?
* Hide order items?
* Hide payment gateway?
* Hide buyer information?
